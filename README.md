# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Different-ML-Techniques
This project focuses on comparing the results for Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Neural Networks for Credit Card Fraud Detection 

# Dataset

The Dataset used for this project is the Kaggle dataset for Credit Card fraud Detection and can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud">here</a>

# Result

The result can be seen as follows :

The neuralnet gave a slight better result where it detected 70 fraud transactions

# Note

Since github was not able to render the ipython notebook so I locally renderred it to html using nbviewer and 
added to the repository.
